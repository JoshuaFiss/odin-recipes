# odin-recipes
This is the first HTML Project from The Odin Project!

Basic Recipe Website

This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

This website will test my skills with HTML and Git/Github! 

By the end of this website I will have demonstrated:
1. HTML Tags and Elements
2. HTML Links
3.  HTML File Structure
4.  Git/Github Staging and Commiting
